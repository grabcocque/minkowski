# Minkowski

A column-oriented database engine built from scratch by one human and one AI.

Minkowski is an archetype ECS that doubles as a transactional database engine. Its typed reducer system proves conflict freedom from closure signatures alone -- no runtime checks needed for scheduled reducers. Split-phase transactions enable safe concurrent reads by keeping `Tx` separate from `&mut World`, and WAL persistence composes with any transaction strategy via a single wrapper type. The engine ships with 295 tests across 4 crates, 8 runnable examples, and passes Miri under Tree Borrows -- all built in one week across 26 PRs.

## What makes this interesting

- **Column-oriented ECS that's also a transactional database engine** -- three mutation tiers (direct, transactional, durable) over the same columnar storage
- **Typed reducers** -- closures whose type signatures prove conflict freedom, enabling compile-time scheduling without runtime validation
- **Split-phase transactions** -- `Tx` does not hold `&mut World`, so concurrent reads via `&World` are sound by construction
- **AI-powered developer tooling** -- an auto-triggering skill provides passive expertise; 13 slash commands guide design decisions across the paradigm
- **Built from scratch in one week** -- 26 PRs, 295 tests, Miri verified under Tree Borrows

## Quick start

```rust
use minkowski::{World, ReducerRegistry, QueryMut};

#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct Pos { x: f32, y: f32 }
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct Vel { dx: f32, dy: f32 }

let mut world = World::new();
let mut registry = ReducerRegistry::new();

// Spawn 1000 entities
for i in 0..1000 {
    world.spawn((Pos { x: i as f32, y: 0.0 }, Vel { dx: 1.0, dy: 0.5 }));
}

// Register a query reducer -- the type signature declares what it reads and writes
let move_id = registry.register_query::<(&mut Pos, &Vel), (), _>(
    &mut world,
    "movement",
    |mut query: QueryMut<'_, (&mut Pos, &Vel)>, ()| {
        query.for_each(|(pos, vel)| {
            pos.x += vel.dx;
            pos.y += vel.dy;
        });
    },
);

// Dispatch -- Access bitset extracted from the type signature at registration
registry.run(&mut world, move_id, ());
```

## Column-Oriented Storage

Each unique combination of component types gets an archetype -- a struct of arrays where each column is a `BlobVec` (type-erased growable byte array with 64-byte alignment). Queries match archetypes via `FixedBitSet` subset checks, then iterate columns with raw pointer arithmetic. No virtual dispatch in the hot path.

Entities are generational `u64` IDs (32-bit index + 32-bit generation). Recycled indices get bumped generations to prevent use-after-free. O(1) lookup from entity to archetype row via `Vec<Option<EntityLocation>>`. Sparse components (`HashMap<Entity, T>`) are opt-in for tags and rarely-queried data, preventing archetype fragmentation.

```rust
let mut world = World::new();
let e = world.spawn((Pos { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 }, Vel { dx: 1.0, dy: 0.0 }));
world.insert(e, Health(100));   // migrates entity to new archetype
world.remove::<Health>(e);      // migrates it back
```

## Query Engine

Two-tier query system with incremental caching. Dynamic queries (`world.query::<(&mut Pos, &Vel)>()`) cache matched archetype IDs per query type -- repeat calls skip the archetype scan entirely, and only new archetypes are scanned incrementally. Static table queries (`world.query_table::<Transform>()`) bypass archetype matching altogether via pre-resolved column offsets.

`Changed<T>` filters skip entire archetypes whose column was not mutably accessed since the last read. Ticks auto-advance on every mutation and query -- there is no manual `world.tick()` call. Parallel iteration via `par_for_each` (rayon) and chunk-based `for_each_chunk` yielding `&[T]`/`&mut [T]` slices for SIMD auto-vectorization.

```rust
// Dynamic query -- cached, skips archetype scan on repeat calls
for (pos, vel) in world.query::<(&mut Pos, &Vel)>() {
    pos.x += vel.dx;
}

// Change detection -- skip archetypes untouched since last read
for pos in world.query::<(&mut Pos, Changed<Vel>)>() {
    // only entities whose Vel column was mutably accessed
}

// Chunk iteration -- yields typed slices for auto-vectorization
world.query::<(&mut Pos, &Vel)>().for_each_chunk(|(positions, velocities)| {
    for i in 0..positions.len() {
        positions[i].x += velocities[i].dx;
    }
});
```

## Typed Reducers

Reducers are closures registered with the `ReducerRegistry`. The type signature declares exactly what the closure can access, and the registry extracts `Access` metadata at registration time for conflict detection.

| Handle | Access | Execution model |
|---|---|---|
| `EntityRef<C>` | Read components in set C for one entity | Transactional |
| `EntityMut<C>` | Read + buffered write + remove for one entity | Transactional |
| `Spawner<B>` | Create new entities with bundle B | Transactional |
| `QueryWriter<Q>` | Buffered bulk iteration via `WritableRef<T>` | Transactional |
| `QueryRef<Q>` | Read-only iteration | Scheduled |
| `QueryMut<Q>` | Read-write iteration with direct `&mut World` | Scheduled |

Scheduled reducers (QueryRef, QueryMut) run with direct world access -- conflict freedom is proven at registration from the Access bitsets. Transactional reducers (EntityMut, Spawner, QueryWriter) buffer writes into an `EnumChangeSet` and commit through a transaction strategy. Dynamic reducers (`DynamicCtx`) trade compile-time precision for runtime flexibility with builder-declared upper bounds.

## Transactions

Three strategies over a unified `Transact` trait. `Tx` does not hold `&mut World` -- methods take world as a parameter, enabling split-phase execution where multiple transactions read concurrently via `&World` before committing sequentially.

- **Sequential** -- zero-cost passthrough, all ops delegate directly to World
- **Optimistic** -- live reads via `query_raw(&self)`, buffered writes, tick-based validation at commit
- **Pessimistic** -- cooperative per-column locks acquired at begin, buffered writes, commit always succeeds

Lock granularity is per-column `(ArchetypeId, ComponentId)`. The lock table is owned by the strategy, not World -- concurrency policy is external to storage.

Entity IDs allocated during a transaction are tracked automatically. On abort, orphaned IDs are pushed to a shared `OrphanQueue` and drained by World at the next `&mut self` call -- no entity ID ever leaks, regardless of how the transaction ends. `WorldId` checks prevent cross-world corruption when strategies are shared across threads.

## Persistence

The `minkowski-persist` crate provides WAL (write-ahead log) and bincode snapshots. `Durable<S, W>` wraps any `Transact` strategy -- on successful commit, the forward changeset is written to the WAL before being applied to World. Failed attempts (retries) are not logged. WAL write failure panics -- the durability invariant is non-negotiable. Recovery loads the latest snapshot and replays subsequent WAL entries.

```rust
// Durable wraps any strategy -- Optimistic, Pessimistic, or Sequential
let durable = Durable::new(strategy, wal, codecs);
durable.transact(&mut world, access, |tx, world| { /* ... */ });
// Changeset written to WAL on successful commit
```

## Schema & Mutation

`#[derive(Table)]` generates compile-time schema declarations with typed row accessors (`FooRef<'w>` / `FooMut<'w>`). Table queries skip archetype matching entirely via pre-resolved column offsets.

```rust
#[derive(Table)]
struct Transform {
    pos: Pos,
    vel: Vel,
}

// Table query -- direct pointer arithmetic, zero archetype matching
for row in world.query_table::<Transform>() {
    println!("{}, {}", row.pos.x, row.vel.dx);
}
```

`EnumChangeSet` records mutations as data with component bytes in a contiguous arena. `apply()` returns a reverse changeset for automatic undo -- applying the reverse restores the previous state. Typed helpers (`insert<T>`, `remove<T>`, `spawn_bundle<B>`) handle component registration and raw pointers internally. `CommandBuffer` provides deferred structural changes during iteration.

## Spatial Indexing

`SpatialIndex` is a lifecycle trait for user-owned spatial data structures. Indexes are fully external to World -- they compose from existing query primitives. The trait has two methods: `rebuild` (full reconstruction) and `update` (optional, for incremental updates via `Changed<T>`). Stale entity references are caught by generational validation at query time.

Two implementations ship as examples: a uniform grid for O(N*k) neighbor search (boids) and a Barnes-Hut quadtree for O(N log N) force approximation (nbody). Both demonstrate that the trait accommodates structurally different algorithms without friction.

## Examples

## AI-Assisted Development

Minkowski was built with Claude Code from the first commit. The development workflow includes:

- **Auto-triggering skill** (`minkowski-guide.md`) -- provides passive expertise on the ECS paradigm whenever Claude Code works in this repo
- **13 slash commands** -- `/design-doc` for feature planning, `/soundness-audit` for concurrency review, `/validate-api` and `/validate-macro` for correctness checks, plus 8 domain-specific commands (`/minkowski:model`, `/minkowski:query`, `/minkowski:mutate`, `/minkowski:concurrency`, `/minkowski:reducer`, `/minkowski:index`, `/minkowski:persist`, `/minkowski:optimize`)
- **Pre-commit hooks** -- `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy -D warnings` run automatically on every commit

The skills teach the paradigm, not just the API -- they encode the design principles and invariants that emerged across 26 PRs of iterative development.

## Design Documents

Design docs for each feature live in [`docs/plans/`](docs/plans/), organized by date. Each feature was designed before implementation -- the design conversation catches semantic bugs (concurrent state corruption, entity ID leaks, lock privilege errors) that compilation and tests miss. Six bugs in the transaction system were caught during design review that would have shipped silently through compilation and testing.

## Building & Testing

```
cargo test -p minkowski                # 295 tests
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo bench -p minkowski               # criterion benchmarks vs hecs
MIRIFLAGS="-Zmiri-tree-borrows" cargo +nightly miri test -p minkowski --lib   # UB check
```

CI runs fmt, clippy, test, and Miri sequentially on every PR. A `ci-pass` aggregator job is the single required status check for branch protection -- it explicitly verifies all four jobs succeeded, avoiding GitHub's "skipped = passed" loophole.

## Roadmap

| Feature | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Query planning (Volcano model) | Optimize complex queries across indexes |
| B-tree / hash indexes | O(log n) lookups by column value |
| rkyv zero-copy snapshots | Zero-copy deserialization matching BlobVec layout |
| Replication & sync | Filtered WAL replay for read replicas and client mirrors |
