//! Transaction strategies for concurrent ECS access.
//!
//! # Design overview
//!
//! The [`Transact`] trait provides optimistic and pessimistic concurrency
//! behind one closure-based interface with automatic retry. [`Sequential`]
//! exists as a zero-cost passthrough for code that doesn't need isolation —
//! users who never touch transactions pay nothing.
//!
//! ## Split-phase execution
//!
//! Tx objects do **not** hold `&mut World`. Methods take the world as a
//! parameter, which splits every frame into three phases:
//!
//! 1. **Begin** (sequential, `&mut World`) — snapshot ticks or acquire locks.
//! 2. **Execute** (parallel, `&World`) — read through `tx.query(&world)`.
//!    Multiple transactions can read concurrently because `query` requires
//!    [`ReadOnlyWorldQuery`], preventing `&mut T` access through a shared
//!    reference. Without this bound the parallel phase would be unsound —
//!    two transactions could obtain aliased `&mut T` from the same `&World`.
//! 3. **Commit** (sequential, `&mut World`) — validate and apply buffered
//!    writes. `commit(self, &mut World)` consumes the transaction so it
//!    cannot be reused.
//!
//! ## Commit, abort, and entity lifecycle
//!
//! Dropping a transaction without calling `commit` is an **abort**: the
//! changeset is discarded, locks are released, and no mutations reach World.
//! `commit` consumes `self` so the compiler enforces exactly-once semantics.
//!
//! Entity IDs allocated during a transaction (`tx.spawn`) are tracked in a
//! `spawned_entities` vec. On successful commit they become placed entities.
//! On abort — whether from an explicit drop or a failed optimistic validation
//! — the IDs must be reclaimed. `Drop` pushes them to an [`OrphanQueue`]
//! shared with World via `Arc<Mutex<Vec<Entity>>>`. World drains this queue
//! automatically at the top of every `&mut self` method, bumping generations
//! and recycling indices. No entity ID ever leaks, regardless of how the
//! transaction ends, and no manual cleanup step is required.
//!
//! [`OrphanQueue`]: crate::world::OrphanQueue
//!
//! ## Cooperative locking (pessimistic)
//!
//! [`Pessimistic`] owns a `Mutex<ColumnLockTable>` — a bookkeeping structure
//! (not an OS mutex per column) tracking shared readers and exclusive writers
//! at `(ArchetypeId, ComponentId)` granularity. When a component appears in
//! both reads and writes, the lock request is **upgraded** to exclusive —
//! `dedup_by` keeps the highest privilege, not the first seen. Locks are
//! acquired in deterministic `(arch, comp)` order to prevent deadlock. The
//! mutex is held only during begin/commit/drop (all sequential phases), never
//! during the parallel read phase.
//!
//! ## World identity
//!
//! Each World gets a unique [`WorldId`] at construction. Strategies capture it
//! and assert it matches in `begin()` and `commit()`. This prevents a strategy
//! created from world A being used with world B, which would push aborted
//! entity IDs into the wrong orphan queue and corrupt unrelated live entities.
//!
//! [`WorldId`]: crate::world::WorldId
