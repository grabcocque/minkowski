# Memory Management

RAM is fast, expensive, and limited. Minkowski provides four complementary features to help you do more with less.

## Pre-allocated Memory Pool

`WorldBuilder` creates a World backed by a single [mmap][mmap] region — all memory is allocated upfront at startup, [TigerBeetle][tigerbeetle]-style. After initialization, `try_spawn` returns `Err(PoolExhausted)` and `try_insert` returns `Err(InsertError)` instead of crashing the process. No dynamic allocation on the data path.

```rust
use minkowski::{World, HugePages, PoolExhausted};

let mut world = World::builder()
    .memory_budget(64 * 1024 * 1024)   // 64 MB fixed budget
    .hugepages(HugePages::Try)          // 2 MiB pages if available
    .lock_all_memory(true)              // mlockall — prevent swapping
    .build()?;

// Spawn until the pool is full — no OOM kill, just a Result
match world.try_spawn((pos, vel)) {
    Ok(entity) => { /* success */ }
    Err(PoolExhausted { .. }) => { /* shed load, evict, or report */ }
}
```

The pool uses size-classed slab allocation (64 B to 1 MB). All worlds use mmap-backed `SlabPool` — `World::new()` creates a 256 MiB demand-paged pool, while `WorldBuilder::memory_budget()` creates a pre-faulted pool with a specific budget and optional hugepage support.

## Blob Offloading

Large per-entity assets (images, meshes, audio) shouldn't live in column storage. `BlobRef` is a lightweight component that stores an external key (S3 path, URL, content hash). The `BlobStore` trait provides a cleanup hook — after despawning entities, collect orphaned refs and let your store delete the external data.

```rust
use minkowski_persist::{BlobRef, BlobStore};

// Entity holds a key, not the bytes
world.spawn((metadata, BlobRef::new("s3://bucket/mesh-00af.bin")));

// After despawn, clean up external storage
store.on_orphaned(&orphaned_refs);
```

`BlobRef` lives in `minkowski-persist` for [rkyv][rkyv] serialization support — blob references survive snapshots and WAL replay. The engine stores only the reference; blob lifecycle is the user's responsibility (same external composition pattern as [indexes](indexing.md)).

## Retention

`Expiry` is a countdown component — it counts retention dispatches, not ticks or wall-clock time. Each call to `registry.run()` decrements all counters by one and despawns entities that reach zero. You control how often retention runs; the engine never runs it automatically.

```rust
use minkowski::{World, Expiry, ReducerRegistry};

let mut world = World::new();
let mut registry = ReducerRegistry::new();
let retention_id = registry.retention(&mut world);

// This entity survives 5 retention dispatches
world.spawn((data, Expiry::after(5)));

// Each call is one "retention cycle" — counters decrement, zeros despawn
registry.run(&mut world, retention_id, ());
```

Together, these four features let a Minkowski deployment run indefinitely within a fixed memory envelope: the pool caps total RAM, blob offloading keeps large assets external, retention prevents unbounded entity growth, and LSM compaction bounds disk-space amplification to ≤ 2×.

## LSM Disk-Space Management

The `minkowski-lsm` crate adds a fourth dimension to memory management: **incremental disk persistence with bounded space amplification**. Where the pool caps in-memory RAM, blob offloading keeps large assets external, and retention prevents unbounded entity growth, LSM compaction prevents unbounded disk usage.

### Dirty-Page Tracking

`storage::dirty_pages` (in the core crate) provides per-column page-level dirty bitsets (256 rows/page). Every `BlobVec` mutation path marks affected pages dirty. On flush, only dirty pages are written to a new sorted-run file — persistence cost is proportional to the mutation rate, not the world size.

```rust
use minkowski_lsm::manifest_ops::flush_and_record;

// Write only the pages that changed since last flush
let report = flush_and_record(&manifest_log, &mut world, &codec, dir)?;
// report.page_count reflects only dirty pages, not total world size
```

### Compaction

Each flush creates a new L1 sorted run. Over time, L1 accumulates overlapping runs for the same archetypes. `compact_one` merges runs atomically — either all input runs are replaced by the output, or none are (via the `CompactionCommit` manifest log entry).

```rust
use minkowski_lsm::{compact_one, COMPACTION_TRIGGER};

// Compact when L1 exceeds the trigger threshold
if let Some(report) = compact_one(&manifest_log, &dir)? {
    println!("Merged {} runs → {} (freed {} bytes)",
             report.input_count, report.output_count, report.bytes_freed);
}
```

Space amplification is bounded at ≤ 2× during compaction (old and new runs coexist briefly). After compaction completes, orphaned files are cleaned up via `cleanup_orphans`.

### Crash Safety

Sorted-run files are immutable once written. A partial flush produces an orphan file not referenced by the manifest — `cleanup_orphans` removes it on the next startup. The manifest log uses CRC32 frames with atomic `CompactionCommit` entries, so recovery replays a consistent prefix of the log.

### What's Next

Phase 5 (pending) will add `LsmRecovery` (restore World from sorted runs + WAL tail) and `Durable<S>` integration (automatic LSM flush instead of full snapshots on checkpoint). Until then, the LSM crate provides flush and compaction primitives that can be called manually.
