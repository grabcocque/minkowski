## Stage 1: The Log

**Status: Complete.** (`minkowski-persist` crate, WAL subsystem)

The log is the foundation of durability. Every committed transaction is written
to the WAL before being applied to the in-memory World. On crash, replay the
log to recover state. The log is also the unit of replication (Stage 4).

### What exists

- `Wal`: segmented write-ahead log with CRC32 frame integrity, rollover, crash recovery
- `Durable<S>`: wraps any `Transact` strategy to add WAL logging on commit
- `WalCursor`: filesystem-specific log reader for pull-based replication
- `ReplicationBatch`: transport-agnostic wire format + `apply_batch`
- `CodecRegistry`: component name → serializer mapping, stable names for schema evolution
- `CrcProof`: zero-sized proof token — gates the raw memcpy fast path (only
  CRC-validated frames bypass rkyv bytecheck)

### The in-memory foundation

The log sits atop a column-oriented archetype ECS:

- `World`: entity allocator, archetype storage, sparse storage, query cache
- `BlobVec`: type-erased column storage with 64-byte alignment for SIMD
- `SlabPool`: mmap-backed slab allocator with thread-local cache
- `QueryPlanner`: cost-based plans, joins, aggregates, index-driven lookups
- `ReducerRegistry`: typed mutation handles with compile-time conflict detection
- `EnumChangeSet`: ordered mutation log with arena allocation
- `Transact`: Sequential, Optimistic (tick-based), Pessimistic (lock-based)

### Key properties carried forward

These properties were established at Stage 1 and are load-bearing for every
subsequent stage:

| Property | Why it matters later |
|---|---|
| **Deterministic reducers** | RSM (Stage 4) requires identical replay across replicas |
| **Ordered mutation log** (`EnumChangeSet`) | Unit of WAL write (Stage 1), replication (Stage 4), and compaction (Stage 3) |
| **Generational entity IDs** | Stale references detected without coordination (Stage 5 cross-shard) |
| **External composition** (indexes, registry, planner outside World) | Clean separation for compute/storage split (Stage 6) |
| **Access bitsets** | Conflict detection generalizes to cross-shard conflict detection (Stage 5) |

---

## Stage 2: Snapshots

**Status: Complete.** (`minkowski-persist` crate, snapshot + checkpoint subsystem)

The log alone means crash recovery replays *every* mutation since the beginning
of time. Snapshots provide a baseline: checkpoint the world state to disk, then
recovery only needs to replay the WAL tail from the last checkpoint.

### What exists

- `Snapshot`: full-world serialization via rkyv (v2 format with CRC32 envelope)
- `CheckpointHandler` / `AutoCheckpoint`: snapshot trigger when WAL exceeds threshold
- `Durable<S>` integration: checkpoint handler fires automatically on WAL rollover

### What makes this a good Stage 2

The WAL and snapshots are properly integrated, not bolted on separately:

1. `Durable<S>` writes the WAL on every commit (Stage 1)
2. `AutoCheckpoint` triggers a snapshot when WAL size exceeds a threshold
3. On recovery: load snapshot → replay WAL from checkpoint sequence number
4. `WalCursor` can read from the checkpoint point for replication
5. `CrcProof` validates both snapshot and WAL frame integrity

### What's missing (prerequisites for Stage 3)

- **WAL compaction**: old segments are deleted after checkpoint but never merged.
  Stage 3 needs a log-structured compaction pipeline.
- **Incremental snapshots**: `Snapshot::save` serializes the entire world every
  time. Large worlds make this prohibitively expensive. Stage 3 replaces this
  with incremental (delta) snapshots via LSM compaction.
- **Column-level change tracking**: `Changed<T>` is archetype-granular (a single
  mutation marks the entire column as changed). Incremental snapshots need
  row-level or page-level dirty tracking.

---

## Stage 3: LSM Tree Storage

**Status: Not started.**

**Goal**: Incremental persistence. Only write what changed, not the entire world.

### The problem

Full-world snapshots are O(world size) regardless of how much changed. A world
with 10M entities and 1KB average row size is ~10 GB. Snapshotting 10 GB to disk
every checkpoint is unsustainable. We need persistence cost proportional to the
*mutation rate*, not the *world size*.

This is also the **128 TiB ceiling** that plagues cloud databases. Many claim
"unlimited storage" but monolithic snapshot save/restore at that scale takes
5–6 hours. The ceiling isn't storage capacity — it's recovery time. If your
recovery procedure is O(total data), your architecture has a hard upper bound
no matter how much disk you provision. LSM breaks this ceiling by making
recovery O(delta since last checkpoint): load the baseline from sorted runs,
replay the WAL tail. Recovery time scales with *mutation rate*, not *world size*.

The ambition here — following TigerBeetle's lead — is a system with no
theoretical upper bound on storage. Petabytes of state, if you can afford the
RAM and NVMe to hold the working set, with object storage for the rest.

### Architecture: LSM over archetypes

The LSM tree operates on **archetype pages**, not individual rows. This preserves
column-oriented access patterns and SIMD alignment.

 └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key design decisions

**Unit of flush: the dirty page, not the row.**
BlobVec columns are already page-aligned (64-byte columns, mmap-backed via
SlabPool). A "page" in the LSM is a contiguous range of rows within one
archetype column. Dirty tracking is a bitset per page. Flush writes only dirty
pages to L1.

**WAL remains the source of truth for crash recovery.**
The LSM is not a replacement for the WAL. The WAL captures the logical mutations
(insert, update, remove, spawn, despawn). The LSM captures the physical state
(page images). On crash, replay the WAL from the last L1 flush point. On clean
shutdown, flush all dirty pages to L1 and discard the WAL.

**Compaction is archetype-aware.**
L1→L2 compaction merges sorted runs for the same archetype. Cross-archetype
compaction is never needed because archetypes are independent column groups.
This means compaction parallelizes trivially across archetypes.

**Reads never touch L1/L2/L3 in normal operation.**
L0 (the live World) always has the latest data. LSM levels are only read during
recovery (snapshot restore) and cold-start (load world from L2/L3). This is a
critical difference from a traditional LSM database where reads must merge
across levels. In Minkowski, the in-memory World IS the merged view.

### New components

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DirtyPageTracker` | Per-column bitset tracking which pages were mutated since last flush |
| `SortedRun` | Immutable file containing sorted archetype page images, with a sparse index for page lookup |
| `FlushWriter` | Writes dirty pages from L0 → L1 as a new sorted run |
| `Compactor` | Merges L1 sorted runs → L2, L2 → L3. Archetype-parallel. |
| `LsmManifest` | Tracks which sorted runs exist at each level, their archetype coverage, and sequence ranges |
| `LsmRecovery` | Restores World from L2/L3 baseline + L1 delta + WAL tail |

### Dependencies on existing infrastructure

- `SlabPool` page alignment → natural page boundary for dirty tracking
- `BlobVec::changed_tick` → drives dirty detection (but needs page granularity)
- `CrcProof` → gates the zero-copy read path from mmap'd sorted runs
- `CodecRegistry` → sorted runs use the same serialization as WAL/snapshots

### Open questions

1. **Page size**: 4 KB (NVMe-aligned) or 64 KB (fewer metadata entries)?
   TigerBeetle uses 64 KB. Larger pages reduce compaction metadata but waste
   space for sparse archetypes.

2. **Compaction scheduling**: background thread vs. cooperative (compact during
   idle frames)? Game loops want deterministic frame times; background compaction
   can spike I/O. Cooperative compaction bounds I/O per frame but extends total
   compaction time.

3. **Archetype migration during compaction**: if an entity moves between
   archetypes (insert/remove component), the old archetype page is dirty and the
   new one is dirty. Compaction must handle tombstones. Does the sorted run
   store tombstones explicitly, or is "page not present" sufficient?

4. **Bloom filters**: traditional LSMs use bloom filters to avoid reading levels
   that don't contain a key. Our "reads never touch L1+" property may make this
   unnecessary for normal operation, but recovery-time reads would benefit.

---

## Stage 4: Replicated State Machine (RSM)

**Status: Not started. Prerequisites: Stage 3 (efficient state transfer for new replicas).**

**Goal**: Fault tolerance. The world survives machine failure.

### The insight

Minkowski already has the two hardest prerequisites for RSM:

1. **Deterministic execution**: the reducer determinism rule (no RNG, no
   HashMap iteration, no system time, no I/O) means two replicas processing
   the same mutation log produce identical state.

2. **Ordered mutation log**: `EnumChangeSet` is an ordered mutation log.
   `Durable<S>` already writes this log to a WAL. RSM extends this from
   "write to local disk" to "replicate to quorum of machines."

### Architecture

```

 ┌─────────┐    log replication    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐
 │ Leader  │ ──────────────────▶   │Follower │    │Follower │
 │         │                       │  (hot   │    │  (hot   │

 └─────────┘                       └─────────┘    └─────────┘
```

All mutations go through the leader. The leader appends to its local WAL and
replicates the log entry to followers. Once a quorum acknowledges, the mutation
is committed. Followers apply mutations in log order — deterministic execution
guarantees convergence.

### Consensus protocol

**Viewstamped Replication (VR)** over Raft. Rationale:

- VR is conceptually simpler (no log compaction, no snapshots-as-part-of-consensus)
- TigerBeetle chose VR for the same reasons
- The Minkowski WAL already has sequence numbers — these become VR operation numbers
- Leader election uses view numbers, not term+index pairs

### Key design decisions

**Log entry = `ReplicationBatch`.**
The existing `ReplicationBatch` is already the transport-agnostic wire format.
RSM replication sends the same bytes that `WalCursor` reads. No new
serialization format needed.

**State transfer uses LSM sorted runs, not full snapshots.**
When a new replica joins or a follower falls too far behind, it needs the full
world state. Instead of a monolithic snapshot (Stage 2), send the LSM L2/L3
sorted runs + L1 delta + WAL tail. This is incremental — if the follower has
a recent baseline, only the delta needs to transfer.

**Reads can go to any replica.**
`World::query_raw(&self)` (the shared-ref read path) requires no mutation. Any
replica can serve reads. This is free linearizable reads for queries that don't
need the absolute latest write — configurable staleness bound.

### New components

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ReplicaGroup` | Manages the set of replicas, their states, and the consensus protocol |
| `LogReplicator` | Sends `ReplicationBatch` entries from leader to followers |
| `ConsensusState` | VR protocol state: view number, op number, commit number, log |
| `StateTransfer` | Sends LSM sorted runs to new/lagging replicas |
| `LeaderElection` | VR view change protocol |

### Dependencies on existing infrastructure

- `ReplicationBatch` → already the wire format
- `WalCursor` → followers use cursor to track replication position
- `apply_batch` → followers apply mutations identically to leader
- `CodecRegistry` → all replicas must agree on component schemas (version negotiation)
- Reducer determinism → guarantees replicas converge

### Open questions

1. **Network transport**: TCP, QUIC, or Unix domain sockets for local clusters?
   TigerBeetle uses io_uring + custom protocol. Minkowski could start with TCP
   and move to io_uring later.

2. **Client interaction model**: do clients send mutation requests to the leader
   (command pattern) or send `ReplicationBatch` directly? The command pattern is
   simpler but adds a serialization hop.

3. **Read staleness**: how stale can follower reads be? Options: linearizable
   (forward reads to leader), bounded staleness (follower serves if within N
   ops), eventual (any follower, any time).

4. **Multi-world**: can one replica group host multiple Worlds? Useful for
   game servers with multiple rooms/instances. Each World is an independent
   state machine sharing the same consensus group.

---

## Stage 5: Horizontal Scaling (Sharding)

**Status: Not started. Prerequisites: Stage 4 (each shard is an RSM).**

**Goal**: Scale beyond one machine's memory and CPU.

### The problem

A single RSM group handles ~1 machine's worth of data and compute. When the
world grows beyond that, we need to partition entities across machines. Each
partition (shard) is its own RSM group with its own leader and followers.

### The ECS advantage

Entities are naturally partitionable:

- Entity IDs are opaque 64-bit handles with no inherent ordering or locality
- Components are per-entity — no cross-entity referential integrity
- Archetypes are independent column groups — an archetype can live entirely on one shard

This is structurally simpler than sharding a relational database where foreign
keys create cross-shard dependencies.

### Sharding strategy

**Phase 1: Hash-based sharding by entity ID.**

```
shard_id = entity.index() % num_shards
```

Simple, uniform distribution, no hotspots. Each shard owns a disjoint subset of
entity indices. Archetype structure is replicated across shards (schema is
global, data is partitioned).

**Phase 2: Range-based sharding by archetype.**

Entities with the same archetype tend to be queried together. Group entities by
archetype and assign archetype ranges to shards. This optimizes query locality —
a query that scans one archetype hits one shard, not all shards.

**Phase 3: Adaptive sharding.**

Monitor query patterns and rebalance shards to minimize cross-shard queries.
Entity migration between shards uses the same archetype migration machinery
(spawn on target shard, despawn on source shard, update routing table).

### Cross-shard operations

This is where Amdahl's law bites.

| Operation | Cross-shard cost |
|---|---|
| `get(entity)` | Route to owning shard — O(1) lookup in routing table |
| `query::<(&Pos, &Vel)>()` | Fan out to all shards, merge results — O(shards) |
| `join()` | Collect entity sets from all shards, intersect — expensive |
| `spatial_query(within)` | Fan out to shards overlapping the spatial region |
| `transact` (single entity) | Route to owning shard — no cross-shard coordination |
| `transact` (multi-entity) | 2PC across owning shards — serialization point |

**The serial fraction**: cross-shard transactions require coordination (2PC or
deterministic scheduling). As cross-shard transaction rate increases, Amdahl's
law limits speedup from adding shards. The break-even point depends on the
workload's locality.

### Key design decisions

**Routing table is a first-class component.**
A `ShardRouter` maps entity index ranges to shard IDs. All shards hold a copy
(replicated via the consensus protocol). Entity migration updates the routing
table atomically.

**Queries are push-down, not pull-up.**
A scatter-gather query sends the query plan to each shard. Each shard executes
locally and returns results. The coordinator merges. This avoids shipping raw
data across the network — only results travel.

**Deterministic scheduling over 2PC.**
Instead of two-phase commit for cross-shard transactions, use deterministic
scheduling: all shards agree on the transaction order (via the consensus log),
then each shard independently executes its portion. No coordination at execution
time. Calvin/BOHM-style. This eliminates the serial coordination bottleneck of
2PC at the cost of requiring all shards to process the full log (even entries
they don't own, to maintain order). TigerBeetle uses this approach.

### New components

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ShardRouter` | Entity → shard mapping with migration support |
| `ShardCoordinator` | Scatter-gather query execution across shards |
| `CrossShardPlanner` | Extends `QueryPlanner` with shard-aware cost model |
| `EntityMigrator` | Move entities between shards (spawn+despawn+route update) |
| `DeterministicScheduler` | Order cross-shard transactions via shared log |

### Open questions

1. **Shard-local indexes**: each shard maintains its own `BTreeIndex`/`HashIndex`
   for local data. Cross-shard index queries require fan-out. Should there be a
   global index tier?

2. **Archetype schema agreement**: all shards must agree on component types and
   archetype structure. How is schema evolution coordinated? (CodecRegistry
   already has stable names — extend with version negotiation.)

3. **Entity migration granularity**: migrate one entity at a time, or batch
   migrate entire archetypes? Archetype-level migration is more efficient but
   less flexible.

4. **Spatial sharding**: for spatially-organized worlds (games, simulations),
   shard by spatial region rather than entity ID. This optimizes spatial queries
   but creates hotspots when entities cluster.

---

## Stage 6: Separate Storage and Compute

**Status: Not started. Prerequisites: Stage 5 (sharding provides the need).**

**Goal**: Scale storage and compute independently.

### The problem

In Stages 1–5, each node stores its data locally. Storage capacity is limited
by local disk. Compute capacity is limited by local CPU. They scale together,
but workloads rarely need both to scale equally. A read-heavy analytical
workload needs more compute but not more storage. A large-world simulation
needs more storage but not more compute per entity.

### Architecture

        │        Object Storage             │
        │        (S3, MinIO, Tigris)        │
        │                                   │
        │  LSM L2/L3 sorted runs            │
        │  WAL segments (archived)          │
        │  No practical capacity limits     │
        └───────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The catch

Object storage has no practical limits on capacity. But you can't process
transactions from object storage — latency is milliseconds per GET, and there's
no random write. Transactions need microsecond-latency random access to the
working set.

This is the fundamental tension that Stage 7 resolves.

### What changes from Stage 5

**Compute nodes become stateless (almost).**
A compute node holds:
- L0: the live World (hot working set, in memory)
- L1: recent dirty pages (local NVMe, acts as a write buffer)

Everything else lives in object storage. If a compute node crashes, another
node can resume by loading the working set from object storage + replaying the
WAL tail.

**LSM L2/L3 move to object storage.**
Compacted sorted runs are uploaded to S3/MinIO. Compute nodes pull them on
demand (cold start, entity migration, recovery). Once uploaded, local copies
can be evicted.

**WAL segments are archived to object storage.**
After a WAL segment is fully replicated and its data is flushed to L1, the
segment is uploaded to object storage for long-term retention. Local WAL
retains only the tail needed for crash recovery.

### Key design decisions

**Object storage is append-only.**
Sorted runs and WAL segments are immutable once written. Updates create new
sorted runs; compaction merges old runs into new ones and deletes the old.
This maps naturally to object storage's PUT/GET/DELETE semantics.

**Compute node working set is demand-paged.**
On cold start, a compute node loads the LSM manifest from object storage,
then lazily fetches sorted run pages as queries touch them. Hot pages are
cached in L1 (local NVMe). This is essentially a cooperative page cache
with object storage as the backing store.

**Schema and routing metadata live in a coordination service.**
Component schemas, shard routing tables, and LSM manifests are small and
rarely change. Store them in etcd/FoundationDB/the consensus log. Compute
nodes subscribe to changes.

### New components

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ObjectStore` | Abstraction over S3/MinIO/local-fs for sorted run storage |
| `RemoteLsmManifest` | LSM manifest stored in object storage + coordination service |
| `PageCache` | Demand-paged cache of sorted run pages from object storage |
| `WalArchiver` | Uploads sealed WAL segments to object storage |
| `ComputeNodeBootstrap` | Cold-start sequence: fetch manifest → load working set → replay WAL tail |

### Open questions

1. **Object storage latency hiding**: S3 GET latency is 50–200ms. Can we
   prefetch pages speculatively based on query patterns? The query planner
   knows which archetypes a query will touch — could it issue prefetch
   requests during plan compilation?

2. **Cost model**: object storage charges per GET/PUT. The compaction scheduler
   must be aware of cost — too-frequent compaction wastes PUT budget, too-rare
   compaction wastes GET budget (more levels to read through on recovery).

3. **Multi-tenancy**: with compute separated from storage, multiple tenants
   can share compute nodes with isolated storage namespaces. How does this
   interact with the shard routing table?

---

## Stage 7: Diagonal Scaling

**Status: Not started. Prerequisites: Stages 3–6.**

**Goal**: Scale everything simultaneously with no architectural ceiling.

### The synthesis

Each previous stage solved one bottleneck but created another:

| Stage | Solved | Created |
|---|---|---|
| 3 (LSM) | Snapshot cost proportional to mutations, not world size | Compaction I/O competes with transaction processing |
| 4 (RSM) | Fault tolerance, durable state | Single-machine throughput ceiling |
| 5 (Sharding) | Horizontal throughput scaling | Cross-shard coordination (Amdahl) |
| 6 (Storage/Compute) | Independent scaling, unlimited storage | Object storage latency for working set |

Stage 7 combines all four into a single architecture where:

- **Object storage** provides unlimited capacity (Stage 6)
- **LSM** provides fast local access to the working set (Stage 3)
- **RSM** provides consistency and fault tolerance (Stage 4)
- **Sharding** provides horizontal throughput (Stage 5)

         └───────────────────────────────────┘
```

### How it works

1. **A mutation arrives** at the shard's leader (routed via `ShardRouter`).

2. **Leader replicates the log entry** to its followers via VR consensus.
   Once a quorum acknowledges, the mutation is committed.

3. **Leader and followers apply the mutation** to their in-memory World (L0).
   Deterministic execution guarantees all replicas converge.

4. **Dirty pages accumulate in L0.** When the dirty page budget is exceeded,
   the flush writer writes dirty pages to L1 (local NVMe).

5. **Compaction merges L1 → L2** (local NVMe → local NVMe). When L2 reaches
   its size budget, **L2 → L3** compaction uploads sorted runs to object storage.

6. **Old sorted runs in object storage are garbage-collected** after major
   compaction produces a new baseline.

7. **Queries within a shard** execute entirely from L0 (in-memory) — no disk I/O.
   LSM levels are only read during recovery.

8. **Cross-shard queries** scatter to shard leaders, execute locally, and
   gather results at the coordinator. The query planner pushes predicates
   and projections to each shard.

9. **Shard rebalancing** migrates entity ranges between shards. The source
   shard writes migrating entities to its log; the target shard's leader
   applies them. The routing table updates atomically via the coordination
   layer.

10. **Node failure** triggers leader election within the RSM group. The new
    leader has all committed log entries (VR guarantee). It rebuilds L0 from
    its local L1 + WAL tail. If L1 is lost (disk failure), it pulls L2/L3
    from object storage.

### The diagonal

"Diagonal scaling" means scaling both vertically (bigger machines, more memory,
faster NVMe) and horizontally (more shards, more replicas) simultaneously,
with object storage as the unbounded backing store. There is no architectural
ceiling — each axis scales independently:

- **More memory** → larger L0 working set → fewer L1 flushes
- **Faster NVMe** → faster compaction → lower L1 read amplification
- **More shards** → higher transaction throughput (up to Amdahl's limit)
- **More replicas per shard** → higher read throughput, better fault tolerance
- **Object storage** → unlimited total capacity, pay per GB

### What Minkowski uniquely brings

An ECS engine at Stage 7 has properties that a general-purpose database does not:

1. **Column-oriented storage is native.** LSM sorted runs are already columnar
   (BlobVec pages). No row-to-column conversion needed.

2. **Entities are partition-friendly.** No foreign keys, no referential integrity
   across entities. Sharding is structurally clean.

3. **Query plans are push-down ready.** The existing `QueryPlanner` generates
   execution plans that can be serialized and sent to remote shards.

4. **Deterministic execution is already enforced.** The reducer determinism rule
   is a cultural and tooling convention, not a runtime check. RSM requires this
   to be an invariant, not a guideline — Stage 4 must add runtime verification
   (e.g., hash the mutation output and compare across replicas).

5. **External composition means clean boundaries.** `ReducerRegistry`,
   `QueryPlanner`, `SpatialIndex` are all external to World. This maps naturally
   to separate compute-layer services that compose over a shared storage layer.

```

**Stage 3 (LSM) is the critical path.** It blocks Stage 4 (efficient state
transfer for new replicas) and is the foundation for Stage 6 (object storage
as LSM backing store). Start here.

**Stages 4 and 5 can partially overlap.** The consensus protocol (Stage 4) can
be developed and tested with a single shard. Sharding (Stage 5) adds the
routing and coordination layer on top. But the cross-shard deterministic
scheduling design should be done upfront — it constrains the consensus protocol.

**Stage 6 is an incremental change to Stage 5.** Once shards have LSM storage,
moving L2/L3 to object storage is a storage backend swap. The hard part is the
demand-paged working set and cold-start sequence.

**Stage 7 is not a separate implementation.** It's the emergent result of Stages
3–6 working together. If each stage is designed with the full architecture in
mind, Stage 7 is "just" integration and tuning.

## Effort Estimates

These are order-of-magnitude estimates, not commitments.

| Stage | Scope | Key risk |
|---|---|---|
| Stage 3 | New crate (`minkowski-lsm`), ~5-8 KLOC | Page-level dirty tracking in BlobVec without breaking SIMD alignment |
| Stage 4 | New crate (`minkowski-consensus`), ~3-5 KLOC | VR protocol correctness (use TLA+ spec or Loom verification) |
| Stage 5 | New crate (`minkowski-shard`), ~4-6 KLOC | Deterministic cross-shard scheduling without 2PC |
| Stage 6 | Extend `minkowski-lsm` + new `minkowski-objstore`, ~3-4 KLOC | Object storage latency hiding for cold start |
| Stage 7 | Integration + tuning, ~2-3 KLOC | Operational complexity (many moving parts) |
